		<h2>Résumé</h2>
<p>&mdash; I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. <strong style="margin-left: 0.0625em;">*</strong> There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.</p>

 New England Patriots
Ridley was drafted in the third round of the 2011 NFL Draft with the 73rd overall pick by the New England Patriots, a round after the Patriots drafted another running back, Shane Vereen, with the 56th overall pick.[7][8][9]

2012 season
In the regular season opener, Ridley had his best game of his early career in a 34–13 win over the Tennessee Titans. He had 125 yards on 21 carries and a touchdown, and also grabbed three catches out of the backfield for 27 yards.[12] In Week 5, he topped his Week 1 performance with 151 yards rushing, with one touchdown, against the Denver Broncos.[13] In his second year, he proved to be a dependable running back in the NFL after racking up 1,263 total yards on 290 carries, while scoring 12 rushing touchdowns during the regular season.[14] His 82 first down rushes ranked third in the league among all NFL running backs. During the AFC Championship against the Baltimore Ravens on January 20, 2013, Ridley suffered a concussion after a head-to-head collision with Bernard Pollard, which also resulted in a fumble and a turnover. The Patriots lost to the Ravens by a score of 13–28.[15]
